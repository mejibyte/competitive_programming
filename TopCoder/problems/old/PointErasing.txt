PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a vector <int> y of length N. 
The values in y describe N points in the plane: 
for each x = 0, 1, ..., N - 1 there is a point at coordinates (x, y[x]). 

Krolik is going to perform the following operation repeatedly: 

	Choose two of the remaining (i.e. not yet erased) points, say A and B, with different y-coordinates. 
	Consider the rectangle with sides parallel to coordinate axes and points A and B in two opposite corners. 
	Erase all points strictly inside the rectangle. 

In each iteration, Krolik must choose A and B in such a way that at least one point is erased. 
If no more operations can be performed, Krolik will count the number of remaining points and write it into a notebook. 
Return a vector <int> containing all possible values of the number Krolik can write down, in ascending order. 


DEFINITION
Class:PointErasing
Method:getOutcomes
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> getOutcomes(vector <int> y)


NOTES
-A point is strictly inside a rectangle if it is inside the rectangle and does not lie on the border of the rectangle. 


CONSTRAINTS
-y will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive. 
-Each element of y will be between 0 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive. 


EXAMPLES

0)
{ 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 4, 3 }

Returns: {4, 6 }

Krolik will end with 4 points if Krolik takes the following steps: 

	Choose (1, 2) and (4, 0) to erase (2, 1) and (3, 1). 
	Choose (0, 1) and (5, 4) to erase (1, 2). 

If Krolik first chooses (0, 1) and (5, 4) to erase (1, 2), 6 points remain and there are no valid moves left.
