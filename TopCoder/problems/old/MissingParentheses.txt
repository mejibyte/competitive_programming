PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given a string of parentheses, you must turn it into a well formed string by inserting as few parentheses as possible, at any position (you cannot delete or change any of the existing parentheses).

A well formed string of parentheses is defined by the following rules:

    The empty string is well formed.
    If s is a well formed string, (s) is a well formed string.
    If s and t are well formed strings, their concatenation st is a well formed string.

As examples, "(()())", "" and "(())()" are well formed strings and "())(", "()(" and ")" are malformed strings.

Given a string par of parentheses, return the minimum number of parentheses that need to be inserted to make it into a well formed string.
