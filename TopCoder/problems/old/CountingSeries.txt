PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given long longs a, b, c and d. The numbers a and b define an arithmetic progression that consists of all numbers of the form a + b*x, where x is a nonnegative integer. Likewise, c and d define a geometric progression that consists of all the numbers that are equal to c * d^y, where y is a nonnegative integer. You are also given a long long upperBound. Return the total number of integers between 1 and upperBound, inclusive, that belong to the arithmetic progression, the geometric progression or both.

DEFINITION
Class:CountingSeries
Method:countThem
Parameters:long long, long long, long long, long long, long long
Returns:long long
Method signature:long long countThem(long long a, long long b, long long c, long long d, long long upperBound)


NOTES
-The ^ operator in this statement denotes the exponentiation operation. For example, 3^0 = 1 and 2^4 = 2*2*2*2 = 16.


CONSTRAINTS
-a, b, c and upperBound will each be between 1 and 1000000000000 (10^12), inclusive.
-d will be between 1 and 100000 (10^5), inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)

1000

Returns: 1000

The arithmetic progression is: 1, 2, 3, 4, ... .
The geometric progression is: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ... . 
Each positive integer is contained in at least one of the progressions.

1)
3

2
1000

Returns: 343

This time, the arithmetic progression is: 3, 6, 9, 12, ... .
The geometric progression is still: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ....
There are 333 multiples of 3 between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and there are 10 powers of 2, 512 being the highest. As these two progressions do not have any common elements, the total result is 343.
