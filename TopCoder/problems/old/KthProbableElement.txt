PROBLEM STATEMENT
M integers are randomly independently chosen from the interval lowerBound...upperBound, inclusive.  Return the probability that the K-th smallest element of the generated set is equal to N.  K=1 refers to the smallest element, K=2 refers to the second smallest element, and so on.


DEFINITION
Class:KthProbableElement
Method:probability
Parameters:int, int, int, int, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double probability(int M, int lowerBound, int upperBound, int N, int K)


NOTES
-The returned value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9.


CONSTRAINTS
-M will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
-lowerBound will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
-upperBound will be between lowerBound and 1000, inclusive.
-N will be between lowerBound and upperBound, inclusive.
-K will be between 1 and M, inclusive.

There are 8 ways to choose 3 numbers from the interval 1..2:
Numbers | 2nd smallest element
 1 1 1  |  1
 1 1 2  |  1
 1 2 1  |  1
 1 2 2  |  2
 2 1 1  |  1
 2 1 2  |  2
 2 2 1  |  2
 2 2 2  |  2
Exactly 4 of the ways have the 2nd smallest element equal to 2.
