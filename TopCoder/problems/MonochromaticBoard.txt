PROBLEM STATEMENT
There is a HxW rectangular board divided into 1x1 cells. Initially each cell is colored White. Fox Ciel wants to change the color of certain cells on the board. You are given a vector <string> board consisting of characters 'B' and 'W'. If the j-th character of the i-th element of board is 'B', she must change the color of cell (i, j) to Black, otherwise this cell must remain White.


Fox Ciel can perform the following operation:


1. Choose one row or one column.

2. Paint the row or the column she chose in step 1 with Black. The color of all cells in the row or the column becomes Black.


Return the minimal number of operations required to change the color to board. The constraints will guarantee that it's always possible.
