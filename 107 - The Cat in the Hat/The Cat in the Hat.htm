<P>(An homage to Theodore Seuss Geisel) 
<P>The Cat in the Hat is a nasty creature,<BR>But the striped hat he is wearing 
has a rather nifty feature. 
<P>With one flick of his wrist he pops his top off. 
<P>Do you know what's inside that Cat's hat?<BR>A bunch of small cats, each with 
its own striped hat. 
<P>Each little cat does the same as line three,<BR>All except the littlest ones, 
who just say ``Why me?'' 
<P>Because the littlest cats have to clean all the grime,<BR>And they're tired 
of doing it time after time! 
<P>
<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A name=SECTION0001002000000000000000>The 
Problem</A></FONT></H2>
<P>A clever cat walks into a messy room which he needs to clean. Instead of 
doing the work alone, it decides to have its helper cats do the work. It keeps 
its (smaller) helper cats inside its hat. Each helper cat also has helper cats 
in its own hat, and so on. Eventually, the cats reach a smallest size. These 
smallest cats have no additional cats in their hats. These unfortunate smallest 
cats have to do the cleaning. 
<P>The number of cats inside each (non-smallest) cat's hat is a constant, 
<I>N</I>. The height of these cats-in-a-hat is <IMG height=31 
alt=tex2html_wrap_inline35 src="The%20Cat%20in%20the%20Hat_archivos/107img1.gif" 
width=30 align=middle> times the height of the cat whose hat they are in. 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The smallest cats are of height one; <BR>these are the cats that 
  get the work done. </BLOCKQUOTE>All heights are positive integers. 
<P>Given the height of the initial cat and the number of worker cats (of height 
one), find the number of cats that are not doing any work (cats of height 
greater than one) and also determine the sum of all the cats' heights (the 
height of a stack of all cats standing one on top of another). 
<P>
<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A name=SECTION0001003000000000000000>The 
Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>The input consists of a sequence of cat-in-hat specifications. Each 
specification is a single line consisting of two positive integers, separated by 
white space. The first integer is the height of the initial cat, and the second 
integer is the number of worker cats. 
<P>A pair of 0's on a line indicates the end of input. 
<P>
<H2><FONT color=#0070e8><A name=SECTION0001004000000000000000>The 
Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>For each input line (cat-in-hat specification), print the number of cats that 
are not working, followed by a space, followed by the height of the stack of 
cats. There should be one output line for each input line other than the ``0 0'' 
that terminates input.
